Atop the sky stars cry out as they splinter in a screech that burrows into your soul. Opening your eyes to the abyss you see it.\n\nA sphere with golden rims carves through another, smaller one. Towards the middle you're flung and stretched as your body and spirit is rend against probability. Yes, this is all you making sense of such calamity through the only means that you can make sense of it. You wrote this. \n\nYour old life is forfeit. You can feel it. Now stuck between the collision of two realities...or perhaps more? Are you the only one? Hello? No, that doesn't make any sense...what now? Oh, you know...\n\nEVIL IS EVIL. LESSER, GREATER, MIDDLING... MAKES NO DIFFERENCE. THE DEGREE IS ARBITRARY. THE DEFINITION'S BLURRED. IF I'M TO CHOOSE BETWEEN ONE EVIL AND ANOTHER...I'D RATHER NOT THOOSE AT ALL.\n\n\nTHE WORLD OF THE WITCHER\nThe many spheres of the multiverse collide, creating a conjunction of multiple realities crashing into each other. Many vile creatures, monsters, humans and elves are cast into a multitude of separate dimensions and realities. The Chaos takes hold and binds the worlds like glue between two surfaces.\n\nThis was before your arrival. The place with which you're about to embark unto was one of the many worlds that survived the conjunction of the spheres. The “Earth” which you will crash-land unto is similar to the one you know of in many ways. It has a sun, a moon, water and land. Most this land is present in the northern hemisphere.\n\n\nTHE RULES ARE QUITE SIMPLE...\nYou seem to have collected an eerily precise amount of shards. The shards vibrate with potent fate-altering power. The spheres have yet to conclude their destructive collision. Yet, you feel as if time matters little now. Make your choices. You have [100 FATE SHARDS X 1 SHARD OF DESTINY] to spend on fate-altering decisions, choices and options that will determine your life in this new world that you will soon inhabit. Alongside these shards, you hold another one. This one, seems to be attuned to you in particular. A special crystal sharp enough to cut through destiny itself. However, dread takes hold of you. Destiny is not often something to be tampered with.\n\nWith deep concentration, you learn that your shard of destiny allows you to bypass and ignore (one) of any requirement or incompatibility of the choices that the fates have offered you. However, doing so, will bind you to the whims of destiny.\n","objectWidth":"col-md-4","image":"","template":"1","isButtonRow":false,"buttonType":true,"buttonId":"","buttonText":"Click","buttonRandom":false,"buttonRandomNumber":1,"isResultRow":false,"resultGroupId":"97","isInfoRow":false,"isPrivateStyling":false,"defaultAspectWidth":1,"defaultAspectHeight":1,"allowedChoices":1,"currentChoices":0,"requireds":[],"isEditModeOn":false,"isRequirementOpen":false,"objects":[{"id":"77qe","title":"Across Time","text":"The flow of time siphons through you.
